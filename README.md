## Aim of the project

On a sport shooting training, nowadays players use electronic target system, which measures the hit by a laser frame and presents the coordinates and value of shots on a graphical interface./
Unfortunately, even if the system is computer controlled and works on a LAN, electronic training log is not available./
I created an application with which this electronic training log can be created from images of the user interface of electronic targeting system.


## Feautures

- Extract the ROI from a picture of the user interface using thresholding
- From ROI, recognize the shot parameters using a complex image recognition algorithm
- Plot the results
